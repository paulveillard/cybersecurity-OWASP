# Acquiring secure software

## Software options
Most of the software used in a company can not be developed internally and have to be purchased from suppliers. Software acquisitions may represent a faster and/or custom response to company needs. Usually the process involves the evaluation of many possibilities, where options can be found within these categories:
* Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
* Made-to-order
* Company acquisitions/mergers
* Open source

## The acquisition process
Most of this software can be run on systems managed by the company, or purchased as an Infrastructure-as-a-service, or provided as Software-as-a-service. As it happens for internal software development, during software acquisition, the company has to ensure the adoption of secure software. The process to achieve a secure application, should follow 4 important steps:
* planning
* contracting
* monitoring and acceptance
* follow on

### Touchpoints
Touchpoints still play a fundamental role in software acquisition as to allow the company to maintain the focus on security.
* Security requirements
* Abuse cases
* Architectural risk analysis
* Security tests
* Code review (from the supplier)
* Penetration testing
* Security operations (security patch releases)

## Planning
During planning a company should outline the need for a new software, identify the security requirements and produce a plan. Evaluation criteria should be defined and possible suppliers should be enquired about.

## Contracting
During contracting the company asks and evaluates proposal before signing the final contract. Any proposal evaluated should include:
* statement of work (for custom softwares)
* terms and conditions
* warranties, software assurances, SLA
* manuals and instructions
* certifications provided by the suppliers
* requirements for the company

Each proposal should be evaluated by subject matter experts.

## Monitoring and acceptance
During this stage the company will monitor the delivery by:
* establishing a work schedule (timelines for meeting)
* implementing change control
* reviewing and accepting deliverables

## Follow on
Security is an ongoing process, therefore, software acquisition does not end when the software is fully delivered to the company, but involves also:
* software maintenance
* procedures for disposal or decommission

Software maintenance should address the release of security patches and ensure through change control that security is not reduced during any future configuration change, upgrade, patch, support. Procedures for disposal or decommission should instead ensure data is properly destroyed, migrated or archived.
