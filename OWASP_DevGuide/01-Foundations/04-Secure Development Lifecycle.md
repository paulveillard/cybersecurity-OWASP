# Development Life cycle

## 'Standard' life cycles

+ **Waterfall Security**;
The waterfall model is a sequential design process, used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation, and Maintenance [[1]].
- **Agile Security**;
Agile software development is a group of software development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that focuses on delivering working software with the minimum amount of work [[2]].
- **Spiral**;
The spiral model is a risk-driven process model generator for software projects. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping [[3]].
- **Rapid Prototyping**;
Software prototyping is the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program being developed. It is an activity that can occur in software development and is comparable to prototyping as known from other fields, such as mechanical engineering or manufacturing [[4]].

## Secure Development Life cycles

### MSDLC
The Security Development Life cycle (SDL) is a software development process that helps developers build more secure software and address security compliance requirements while reducing development cost.[[5]].

As a result of its commitment to trustworthy computing proclaimed in 2002, Microsoft deﬁned the SDL to address the security issues they frequently faced in their products. SDL comprises a set of activities, which complement Microsoft’s development process and which are particularly aimed at addressing security issues.

MSDLC can be characterized as follows:
- Security as a supporting quality
- Well-deﬁned process
- Good guidance
- Management perspective

### CLASP
CLASP (Comprehensive, Lightweight Application Security Process) provides a well-organized and structured approach for moving security concerns into the early stages of the software development life cycle, whenever possible [[6]].

Originally deﬁned by Secure Software and later donated to OWASP, CLASP is a lightweight process for building secure software. It includes a set of 24 top-level activities, which can be tailored to the development process in use.

Key characteristics include:
- Security at the center stage
- Limited structure
- Role-based
- Rich in resources

### Touchpoints
The touchpoints are one of the three pillars of software security. Attaining software security may not be easy, but it doesn't have to be a burden. By describing a manageable small set of touchpoints (or best practices) based around the software artifacts you already produce, religious warfare over process is avoided and the focus is set on the business of software security [[7]].

Touchpoints provides a set of best practices that have been distilled over the years out of the extensive industrial experience of its proposer. Most of the best practices, named activities from here on, are grouped together in seven so-called touch points.

Touchpoints can be characterized as follows:
- Risk Management
- Black vs White
- Flexibility
- Examples
- Resource

## Advise
We do not recommend to abandon your current development life cycle and switch to a secure one. These security development life cycles are provided as a source to migrate your own development life cycle to a secure version thereof. We recommend to use small changes of your process and use an evaluation period to ensure that everybody sees the benefits before including the next phase.
