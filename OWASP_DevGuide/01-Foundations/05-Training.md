# Training

"It's all to do with the training: you can do a lot if you're properly trained." -- *Queen Elizabeth II*

Training is not a one-off exercise (pun intended). Proper training is a continuous endeavor.  Next to the training that is provided at various OWASP Conferences (Appsec EU, Appsec USA, Appsec Asiapac, Appsec Latam tour), local OWASP events and through this development guide, there are other organizations that provide secure development programs. Known ones are:
- SANS
- ISC2

Also various application security organizations provide forms of training.
