# About the Development Guide

Welcome to the OWASP Development Guide 3.0

This guide has been re-written from the ground up, multiple times until it came to the current state. It has been expanded, shrunk and rebuild under multiple leaders as this is a hard subject.
Where the previous guides tried to be a single stop of all information we decided to have a new approach and separated the language specific examples from the language agnostic principles. This allows adding coding examples for new languages without having to rewrite the whole guide. This meant that the current form has been divided into a couple of components:
1. This guide that has the overall information
2. A companion website that has code examples in various coding languages
3. An exercise guide (to be released)

The Guide has also been aligned with the OWASP Testing Guide and the OWASP Application Security Verification Guide (ASVS) where possible in order to provide a unified guidance towards security.

Security is not a black and white field; it is many shades of grey. In the past, many organizations wished to buy a simple silver security bullet – “do it this way or follow this check list to the letter, and you’ll be safe.” The black and white mindset is invariably wrong, costly, and ineffective.
The Guide strongly recommends the use of threat risk modeling as a way to reduce development costs and time, and eliminate wasted resources. Instead, with careful selection of controls via threat risk modeling, only those controls that demonstrably reduce the risk are implemented. These controls are usually cheap, effective, and simple to implement.

In some countries, risk-based development is not an optional extra, but legally mandated. For example, a core control required by Sarbanes Oxley is to prove that adequate controls are in place for financial systems, and that senior management believes the controls are effective. The Guide provides keys into COBIT (the most commonly used control framework for SOX) to assist organizations produce applications that meet SOX requirements.

As with any long-lived project, there is a need to keep the material fresh and relevant. Therefore, some of the material from the older Guides has been migrated to OWASP’s portal or outright replaced with new advice.

Thanks to the many authors and editors for their hard work in bringing this guide to where it is today. If you have any comments or suggestions on the Guide, please e-mail the Guide mail list (see our web site for details) or contact me directly.
