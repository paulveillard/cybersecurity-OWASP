# README for OWASP DevGuide Appendices

## Purpose

This folder is intended for any appendix that should be included at the end of the new [GitHub repository of the OWASP DevGuide]((https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/).

## Suggested Naming Conventions

It is suggested that the following naming conventions be used so that we don't
have namespace collisions. Hopefully, this will help sort the order of all the
appendices as well.

Name the appendix file according to the following format:

    section#-sectionName-appendix#-short_descriptive_text.md

where appendix# is two decimal digits. For example,

    0x11-Cryptography-01-table_of_cryptographic_algorithms.md
    0x11-Cryptography-02-crypto-overview-diagram.md
    etc.

## Contact

Please contact the **Project Lead: Andrew van der Stock** for any queries about what should be placed here.
