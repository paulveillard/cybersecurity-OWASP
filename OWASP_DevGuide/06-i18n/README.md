#Translations

The [original English version](https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide) is the source of truth, as it is maintained and updated first.

*All translations are created by and maintained by the community.*

  1. [Language](ex-EX.md) by [Foo Bar](https://github.com/yourname/i18nRepo) 

## Contributing
Language translations are welcomed and encouraged. The success of these translations depends on the community. I highly encourage new translation contributions and help to keep them up to date.

All translations must preserve the intention of the original document.

> All contributions fall under the same license. In other words, you would be providing these free to the community.
